Midterm: Basic Inventory Management System
Objective:
The goal of this assignment is to help you understand how to implement class methods and constructors in C#. You will be provided with a class outline, including a constructor and five methods with empty bodies. Your task is to implement the logic inside each method according to the provided specifications. The outline is provided in a GitHub repository 
Assignment Details:
1.	Clone the provided GitHub repository to your local machine.
2.	Open the project; you will find a file named InventoryItem.cs which contains the structure of the InventoryItem class. This class includes several properties, a constructor, and five methods with empty bodies.
Your task is to:
Implement the logic inside the constructor to initialize the class properties.
Fill in the body of each method according to its intended function:
•	UpdatePrice(double newPrice): Update the price of the item.
•	RestockItem(int additionalQuantity): Increase the item's stock quantity.
•	SellItem(int quantitySold): Decrease the item's stock quantity by the specified amount, ensuring the quantity does not go negative.
•	IsInStock(): Check if the item is currently in stock.
•	PrintDetails(): Print the details of the item (name, ID, price, quantity).
•	In addition to the InventoryItem class, you will find a Program.cs file with a Main method. Implement logic within this method to create instances of InventoryItem, demonstrating the functionality of its methods.


Submission Instructions:
1.	Once you have completed your implementation, push your changes to a public GitHub repository. 
2.	Make sure that your repository is public, so it can be accessed and graded. 
3.	Submit the URL of your public GitHub repository as your assignment submission.
Evaluation Criteria:
1.	Correctness of implementation for all class methods and the constructor.
2.	Proper use and demonstration of object-oriented programming principles.
3.	Clarity and cleanliness of the code.
4.	The functionality of your code will be tested with different parameters to ensure it behaves as expected.
Notes:
Pay attention to the details of each method's intended behavior, especially regarding how they should interact with the class properties.
Test your code thoroughly to ensure it behaves as expected in various scenarios.
Remember to commit and push your changes to GitHub for submission.
